# Tutorial Material

You can find our  **tutorial's slides** here ([pdf](/assets/documents/2026_AAAI_Foundations_Of_Interpretable_Deep_Learning_Tutorial_Slides_Final.pdf)).


The first part of our talk was inspired by our position paper on ["Symmetries of Interpretable Models"](/assets/documents/Foundations_of_Interpretable_Deep_Learning.pdf).


If we get access to a recording of our presentation, we will include it in this
section as soon as possible.

For a **complete bibliography** of the topics and works discussed in this tutorial,
pease refer to our [resources](/resources/) section.
